I'm Charles Menguy, and I find it really hard to put a tag on myself as I enjoy software engineering as much as data science.
My interests and experience lie along 3 main axes:
<ul>
    <li><b>Big Data</b>: Experienced in dealing with multi-Terabyte datasets, both at the infrastructure as well as analytics levels.</li>
    <li><b>Data Science</b>: Good knowledge of ML algorithms (both supervised and unsupervied) and when to use them, recently started looking at Deep Learning techniques and how to leverage it.</li>
    <li><b>Cloud Computing</b>: I've been using AWS <b>a lot</b> and can work my way through pretty much any AWS service. Also looked into Google Compute Engine where I am still learning.</li>
</ul>
I also have DevOps chops to help when needed configuring/deploying/maintaining Hadoop or Spark clusters.

I currently work and live in the United States, in New York City, where I have spent most of my professional life.
Initially graduated from EPITA in Paris, France, where I obtained a Master's degree in Computer Science, with a major in cognitive science.
I enjoy more than anything traveling abroad and discovering new cultures.
