    Currently working on bringing AI capabilities to the company's segmentation platform by working closely with
    product owners and research scientists. Responsibilities include:
    • Research and development of an automated segmentation system to package audiences into explainable clusters. 
    Research involves evaluating several *clustering algorithms*, as well as  an exploration platform to refine clusters.
    • Research and Development of a *contextualization engine* using a *knowledge graph*, to build a more granular 
    user profile based on the content of the webpages.
    • Development of a Data Science platform to allow internal and external users to run Data Science experiments 
    at scale in an integrated end-to-end framework.
    • Design and development of a *lookalike modeling framework*. Research involves multiple sketches and algorithms 
    to run at very large scale and in realtime as well as batch.

2015-2017

    the entire company. Responsibilities included:
    • Partnering with product owners and prospective customers to determine engineering and research direction.
    • Research of techniques and algorithms that could work at scale and designed a prototype using a 
    *graph-based* approach with *Spark* and *Kafka* on top of *Amazon Web Services*.
    • End-to-end development in *Scala* of the original prototype using *Spark*, *Amazon EMR*, and transmitting data 
    over *Kafka* encoded using *Protocol Buffers*.
    • Development of evaluation and reporting framework using Spark and sending data to *OpenTSDB*.
    • Development of an orchestration layer using *Amazon's Data Pipeline* (now *Glue*)

    from different data sources with *Hive* and *Redshift* processing dozens of Terabytes daily. 150+ Terabytes stored.
    • High-frequency distributed multi-threaded cookie exchange service built inJava with a custom 
    streaming protocol based on *Amazon SQS*, making tens of thousands HTTP requests per second to 
    dozens of ad networks/DSPs/DMPs.
    • Participation in the development of an *algorithmic segmentation* framework based on *Hive* using TF-IDF.
    • Complete backend development of a customer segmentation platform from scratch in *Java*
    using *Hadoop*, *HBase* and *Cassandra*, managing more than 10 Billion profiles. This was done
    by leveraging Amazon Web Services in multiple regions, in particular *EC2*, *EMR* and *SQS*.

2011-2012

    business value of website visitors.  
    • Using *Hadoop* and *Pig* to develop reporting infrastructure, and operational improvements.  
    • Implementation of a job controller to standardize the company's *Hadoop* pipeline and scheduling.  
    • High-frequency monitoring system to collect *Hadoop* metrics via *ZeroMQ* and analyzed via
    *Esper* to detect outliers and trends and visualized in *Graphite*.

2010-2011
